=========

You Are a Battleship!

That is, you *think* you are a battleship. In reality, you are a normal office drone.

(...but not just *any* office drone, for You Are a Battleship!)

==Installation==

0. Install Love2D! (Current supported version: 0.9.0)
1. Download a .zip of this very repository!
2. Rename that zip to something.love (I suggest YAB.love)
3. Run that .love file using Love!

Note: I think Github might structure the .zip archive with a folder at the top level. If this is the case, follow the alternate directions below!

===Alternatively===

1. Put this repo into its own directory (unpack .zip, clone it, etc.)
2. Make sure you have this directory structure:
  yab/
    - main.lua
    - conf.lua
    - resources/
    - src/
3. Run `love yab/`
